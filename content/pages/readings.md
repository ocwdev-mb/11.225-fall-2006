Weekly Readings
---------------

In order to be able to write arguments, you need to read well-written published arguments. So, each week you should be reading 5 to 10 opinion/editorial pieces. Op-Ed pieces are a good way to learn about how to write concisely and how to create a persuasive argument. Op-Ed pieces can be found in any newspaper, but here are a few Web links to make it really easy.

[_Kennedy School of Government News and Communications: Op-Eds_](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events)

[_The Boston Globe_](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/)

[_The Wall Street Journal_](http://online.wsj.com/public/us)

[_The New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/)

[_The Washington Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/)

If you find an op-ed piece that you like, please don't hesitate to bring it into class.
